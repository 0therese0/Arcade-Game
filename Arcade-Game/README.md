# Arcade Game

This is Udacity's third project for Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  A simple Arcade/Frogger game.

## How the game works
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down using keyboard arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.

The score board contains player score and life. Score increases each time the player reaches the water.  Player life is reduced by one each time player collides with enemy/bugs. Once the player runs out of life the game ends, reset and the player moves back to the start square.
